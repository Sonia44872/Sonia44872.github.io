      <h2>Mathematics communication and public engagement</h2>

      During my university, I've been actively involved in communicating mathematics to wider audiences, with emphasis on the people and contexts behind mathematical ideas. I am interested in education, but also you might find me reading a history of maths article and contemplating how great it would be if such course existed at university!
 My writing and engagement in this area includes
      <h3>Published articles and blog pieces</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="https://mancunion.com/2025/01/29/the-big-journey-to-fermats-little-theorem/" target="_blank">
            An article for The Mancunion on Fermat's Little Theorem on the historical and dialogical development behind the result.
          </a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://vahagnaslanyan.wordpress.com/2025/10/08/the-summer-i-became-a-mathematician-reflections-on-the-lms-summer-school-and-my-project/" target="_blank">
            My reflections on my LMS-funded summer education project and summer school featured in Dr. Vahagn Aslanyan's blog.
          </a>
        </li>
                <li>
          <a href="https://www.lms.ac.uk/sites/default/files/inline-files/NLMS_517.v5.nocrop_0.pdf" target="_blank">
           Here you can see the same article published in the 2025 December issue of the LMS Newsletter!
          </a>
        </li>
                       <li>
 Regular contributions to the Equality, Diversity and Inclusion blog of the University of Manchester's mathematics department, writing about conferences and initiatives supporting underrepresented groups in mathematics (most recently, a conference in Bristol).
        </li>
                               <li>
I am currently awaiting publication of an article on Emmy Noether in the Chalkdust Magazine, focusing on her mathematics alongside the barriers she faced.
                                 I am happy to share a draft of the article that is currently under review!
        </li>
      </ul>
<h3> Talks and presentations</h3>
      <li> This includes a couple talks I did at different university societies, and they include: talks about Fermat, famous group theorists in history, linking chaos theory to incompatibilism and much more.
      </li>
      
      <p>
      A couple talks I did at the Institute of Teaching and Learning conference in July 2025 include:</p>
        <li>Poster presentation: Generating and Communicating Ideas: Co-creation and Student Voice in Teaching Materials — developed with the Library Student Team, based on analysis of EducateMCR 2025 survey data.
</li>
     <li>  Lightning talk: Classic UoM – Student Experience Issues — co-presented with Kai Prince and Dr Neil Morrison (Maths Welfare Tutor), addressing systemic administrative challenges faced by students.
      </li>


      <h2> Creative writing</h2>

      <p>In parallel with my mathematical writing, I maintain a personal writing practice focused on reflection, identity, and language. I write primarily prose, technically under the umbrella term "creative nonfiction", often drawing on existentialist and absurdist frameworks, and I am interested in how voice and form change in response to lived experience.
Some of this work is unpublished and intentionally personal. 
       <p> A recent series explores a life-changing medical event and its impact on the self; the leading piece from this series is forthcoming in a small independent zine.</p>
        
<p>I have also previously written book reviews for the University of Manchester Library Student Team. More recently, I have moved this reflective writing to a personal blog, where I experiment more.</p>
        
This kind of work differs from my mathematical interests, but it is neccessary in the sense that it helps me not lose my head!</p>
      <h2>Other things that influence me</h2>
      <h3>Books, essays and beyond</h3>
      <p>
        I have quite an interesting relationship with literature and books in general. Some books I read shaped who I am
        and, for the past year, some books literally helped me recover my language cognition skills. I will outline those
        books that, if you were to read them, you'd understand a bit better why I am the way I am.
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>The Stranger</em> by Albert Camus</li>
        <li><em>The Gay Science</em> by Friedrich Nietzsche</li>
        <li><em>Iona</em> by Marin Sorescu</li>
        <li><em>Kafka on the Shore</em> by Haruki Murakami</li>
        <li><em>A Mathematician's Lament</em> by Paul Lockhart</li>
        <li><em>Love and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality</em> by Edward Frenkel</li>
        <li><em>How I Wish I’d Taught Maths</em> by Craig Barton</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Music</h3>
      <p>Similarly, here are some albums that shaped me:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><em>The Family Jewels</em> by Marina (then Marina and The Diamonds)</li>
        <li><em>Somewhere In The Between</em> by Streetlight Manifesto</li>
        <li><em>Tata Kazika</em> by Kult</li>
        <li><em>Piła tango</em> by Strachy Na Lachy</li>
        <li><em>The Boy Who Knew Too Much</em> by Mika</li>
      </ul>

      <h3>Other hobbies</h3>
      <p>
        Outside my academic and philosophical interests, I enjoy volunteering and of course, reading. I try my best to be a regular at local reading groups and creative writing workshops. And at Parkrun. Sometimes.
      </p>
      <p>
        Most recently, I volunteered at the Manchester Literature Festival. It was an amazing
        experience where I got to hear spoken word on reggae beats, meet Marcus du Sautoy, and hear the poems
        of Seamus Heaney.
