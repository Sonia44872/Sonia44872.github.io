    <h2>Philosophy & Writing</h2>
    <p>As I said, I love philosophy, more specifically I am interested in existentialism and absurdism (both worthy solutions of nihilism!). I’m really passionate about writing and hope to publish more on my personal blog. I am quite a reflective person (or so I've been told!) and I need a medium to let all my reflections outwards.</p>
    <ul>

  <h3>Books that Influence Me</h3>
  <p>I have quite an interesting relationship with literature and books in general. Some books I read shaped who I am and, for the past year, some books literally helped me recover my language cognition skills. I will outline those books that, if you were to read them, you'd understand a bit better why I am the way I am.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>The Stranger</em> by Albert Camus</li>
    <li><em>The Gay Science</em> by Friedrich Nietzsche</li>
    <li><em>The Last Night of Love, The First Night of War</em> by Camil Petrescu</li>
    <li><em>Iona</em> by Marin Sorescu</li>
    <li><em>Kafka on the Shore</em> by Haruki Murakami</li>
    <li><em>A Mathematician's Lament</em> by Paul Lockhart</li>
    <li><em>Love and Math: The Heart of Hidden Reality</em> by Edward Frenkel</li>
    <li><em>How I Wish I’d Taught Maths</em> by Craig Barton</li>
  </ul>
</div>

<div class="block">
  <h3>Music</h3>
  <p>Similarly, here are some albums that shaped me:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><em>The Family Jewels</em> by Marina (then Marina and The Diamonds)</li>
    <li><em>Tata Kazika</em> by Kult</li>
    <li><em>Life in Cartoon Motion</em> by Mika</li>
  </ul>
</div>


<div class="block">
  <h3>Other Hobbies</h3>
    <p>Outside my academic and philosophical interests, I enjoy volunteering and of course, writing. I see these activities as part of the same curiosity that drives my work in mathematics and education.</p>
     <p>Last time I volunteered for the Manchester Literature Festival. It was an amazing experience where I got to hear spoken word on reggae beats, to meet Marcus du Sautoy, and hear the poems of Seamus Heaney. </p>
