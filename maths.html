        <p>My maths interests, as I said, extend in two dimensions: Abstract Algebra and Maths Education. I am of the firm conviction that the scientific community is really bad at communicating and this is why maths has such a bad name. I will probably write a reflective piece on this but for the time being, I recommed you to read Paul Lockhart's A Mathematician's Lament.</p>
        <p>Here is my pride and joy: my maths edu summer research internship project under prof. Louise Walker</p>
