<h2>About Me</h2>

<p>Hello, I am Sonia (please call me Sonia, not Sarah!) Firstly, I am currently a Mathematics student at the University of Manchester. My interests lie in Abstract Algebra (in particular, non-commutative algebra!) and Maths Education. Secondly, I have a lot of roles at the University: Library Student Team member, Student Rep Coordinator, Peer-assissted Study Sessions Coordinator, MathSoc committee member, and overall helper with departmental initiatives (this was a mouthful). Thirdly, I am passionate about continental philosophy, reading, and writing. I hope that one day I will find a way to bridge these hobbies together. Until then, I will keep on exploring the world and myself!</p>

<h3>What do I do?</h3>
<p>You will find a common denominator amongst my roles: I like working behind the scenes.</p>

<div class="block">
  <h4>Library Student Team Member</h4>
  <p>I got into the role in September 2024. More generally, the role implies facilitating and helping refresh the study-skills workshops delivered by the library to UoM students. More specifically, I help refresh and QA the workshops to make sure they are relevant, representative and accessible to students. I was also involved in a bunch of other projects, the highlight being helping design and deliver a poster presentation at the Institute of Teaching and Learning conference about alternative assessments in HE.</p>
</div>

<div class="block">
  <h4>Student Rep Coordinator</h4>
  <p>I am passionate to drive change at this University. My role involves making the student rep system more visible and overseeing that the feedback loops are done properly within the student body.</p>
</div>

<div class="block">
  <h4>PASS Coordinator</h4>
  <p>As a PASS Coordinator, I design the weekly teaching materials based on activities I have researched in my summer maths education project and train PASS Leaders (the ones delivering them) on how to better facilitate the activities (e.g. Self- and peer-feedback, Self-explanation, Distributed learning, etc.)</p>
</div>

<div class="block">
  <h4>MathSoc Committee Member</h4>
  <p>In MathSoc I make sure that the "academic" activities run smoothly, including taking the lead for two years on organising a UK-wide maths competition.</p>
</div>

<div class="block">
  <h4>Manchester Interdisciplinary Mathematics Undergraduate Conference Organiser</h4>
  <p>This role speaks to my values of having an interdisciplinary, communal approach to maths.</p>
</div>

<div class="block">
  <h4>Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA) — Pending</h4>
  <p>Here’s an excerpt from the conclusion of my FHEA application:</p>
  <blockquote>
    “As demonstrated above, I took on many opportunities both within my department, my faculty, and at the library. My continued motivation behind these is for two reasons:
    Firstly, ever since I first set foot in this university, I felt at home. After some negative experiences back in high-school, I view UoM as a supportive, collaborative and inclusive environment, full of people that want others to succeed. I was suddenly faced with a life-altering health event last year and part of my successful recovery was thanks to this community. My activities are a way of giving this community something back, whilst also improving the accessibility of the experience of teaching and learning for students.
    Similarly, my work within the maths department is a representation of my maths teachers that believed that I could become the person I am now.”
  </blockquote>

<p>This pic of me is when I was handed the 3rd place for the <b>University of Manchester Volunteering Award</b> for work undertaken that supports other students.</p>

<p>Because I guessed that you would be wondering where my name is from - I am from Romania.</p>
