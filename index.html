        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, I am Sonia. I am currently a Mathematics student at the University of Manchester. My interests lie in abstract algebra (in particular, non-commutative algebra!) and mathematics education.
        </p>
        <p>
          I also hold a number of roles at the University: Library Student Team member, Student Rep Coordinator, Peer-assisted Study Sessions Coordinator, MathSoc committee member, and general helper with departmental initiatives (a bit of a mouthful). Outside of mathematics, I am passionate about continental philosophy, reading, and writing. One day I hope to bring these strands together more coherently; for now I am still exploring the world and myself.
        </p>
        <p>
          This picture of me was taken when I was handed 3rd place for the <strong>University of Manchester “Volunteer of the Year Award”</strong> for work undertaken that supports other students.
        </p>
        <p>
          Because I guessed you might be wondering where my name is from – I am from Romania.

      <section id="roles">
        <h2>What do I do?</h2>
        <p>You will find a common denominator amongst my roles: I like working behind the scenes.</p>

        <div class="block">
          <h4>Library Student Team Member</h4>
          <p>
            I started this role in September 2024. Broadly, it involves helping refresh and support the study-skills workshops delivered by the library to UoM students. More specifically, I work on updating and QA-ing workshop materials to make sure they are relevant, representative and accessible. I was also involved in other projects, including helping design and deliver a poster presentation at the Institute of Teaching and Learning conference about alternative assessments in higher education.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <h4>Student Rep Coordinator</h4>
          <p>
            I am passionate about driving change at the university. My role involves making the student rep system more visible and helping to ensure that feedback loops between students and staff actually function in practice.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <h4>PASS Coordinator</h4>
          <p>
            As a PASS Coordinator, I design weekly teaching materials based on activities I explored in my summer maths education project, and I train PASS Leaders in how to facilitate them (for example self- and peer-feedback, self-explanation, and distributed learning activities).
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <h4>MathSoc Committee Member</h4>
          <p>
            In MathSoc I help ensure that academic activities run smoothly, including taking the lead for two years on organising a UK-wide maths competition.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <h4>Manchester Interdisciplinary Mathematics Undergraduate Conference Organiser</h4>
          <p>
            This role speaks to my values of seeing mathematics as interdisciplinary and communal. I help shape the conference programme and support undergraduate speakers in sharing their work.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div class="block">
          <h4>Fellowship of the Higher Education Academy (FHEA) — pending</h4>
          <p>Here’s an excerpt from the conclusion of my FHEA application:</p>
          <blockquote>
            “As demonstrated above, I took on many opportunities both within my department, my faculty, and at the library. My continued motivation behind these is for two reasons:
            Firstly, ever since I first set foot in this university, I felt at home. After some negative experiences back in high-school, I view UoM as a supportive, collaborative and inclusive environment, full of people that want others to succeed. I was suddenly faced with a life-altering health event last year and part of my successful recovery was thanks to this community. My activities are a way of giving this community something back, whilst also improving the accessibility of the experience of teaching and learning for students.
            Similarly, my work within the maths department is a representation of my maths teachers that believed that I could become the person I am now.”
