      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>Hello, I am Sonia (please call me Sonia, not Sarah!) Firstly, I am currently a Mathematics student at the University of Manchester. My interests lie in Abstract Algebra (in particular, non-commutative algebra!) and Maths Education. Secondly, I have a lot of roles at the University: Library Student Team member, Student Rep Coordinator, Peer-assissted Study Sessions Coordinator, MathSoc committee member, and overall helper with departmental initiatives (this was a mouthful). Thirdly, I am passionate about maths, continental philosophy, reading, and writing. I hope that one day I will find a way to bridge these hobbies together. Until then, I will keep on exploring the world and myself!</p>
      <p>Because I guessed that you would be wondering where my name is from - I am from Romania.</p>

      <div class="block">
        <h3>Maths Stuff</h3>
        <p>My maths interests, as I said, extend in two dimensions: Abstract Algebra and Maths Education. I am of the firm conviction that the scientific community is really bad at communicating and this is why maths has such a bad name. I will probably write a reflective piece on this but for the time being, I recommed you to read Paul Lockhart's A Mathematician's Lament.</p>
        <p>Here is my pride and joy: my maths edu summer research internship project under prof. Louise Walker</p>

      <div class="block">
        <h3>Non-Maths Stuff</h3>
        <p>As I mentioned earlier, I enjoy (some) philosophy but I am mainly passionate about existentialism and absurdism (both worthy solutions of nihilism!). I am really passionate about writing and I hope to publish more on my personal blog.</p>
